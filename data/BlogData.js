Chest pain or discomfort is one of the most common signs—it may feel like pressure, tightness, heaviness, or a squeezing sensation in the center of your chest. Shortness of breath during normal activities like walking or climbing stairs also signals potential heart issues. Other symptoms include fatigue, swelling in the legs or feet due to fluid buildup, irregular heartbeat, dizziness, and fainting. These signs should never be ignored, as early treatment prevents serious complications."

Shortness of breath during normal activity or while resting indicates the heart is struggling to pump blood effectively. Other warning signs include fatigue, swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet due to fluid retention, dizziness, light-headedness, and irregular heartbeat (palpitations).

Coronary artery disease is the most common—it occurs when arteries become narrow or blocked due to cholesterol deposits. Heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart muscle is suddenly cut off. Heart failure occurs when the heart becomes too weak or stiff to pump blood efficiently. Arrhythmias refer to irregular heartbeat patterns that may feel like fluttering or skipping beats. Valve diseases occur when heart valves do not open or close properly. High blood pressure also puts excessive strain on the heart, increasing the risk of severe complications."
